# 🛒 Faheem's E-Commerce Application (Java Swing)

Welcome to the **Faheem's E-Commerce App**—a visually appealing and feature-rich desktop application built with **Java Swing**! This project simulates an e-commerce platform, incorporating user-friendly design and robust functionality, perfect for practicing **data structures** such as `LinkedList`, `Stack`, and `Queue` in a real-world scenario. 

## 🌟 Features

### 🚀 **Introduction Screen**
- **Animated Welcome Screen**: A sleek, dynamic transition with fade-in effects introduces users to the app.

### 🛍️ **Product Showcase**
- **Grid View**: Display products in a visually appealing grid layout.
- **Filter Options**: (Future implementation) Filter by categories like *Electronics*, *Fashion*, *Home & Kitchen*, and *Gaming*.
- **Search Bar**: Quickly find products by name.

### 🛒 **Shopping Cart**
- Add items to the cart with customized quantities.
- Real-time price calculations for selected quantities.
- **Undo** functionality using a stack-based mechanism.
- Remove items from the cart seamlessly.

### 🏷️ **Checkout**
- Enter user details like Name, Address, and Payment Method.
- Summary of the total price and items before finalizing the order.

### 🧩 **Data Structures in Action**
- **LinkedList**: Manage the shopping cart items.
- **Stack**: Enable undo functionality for cart actions.
- **Queue**: Simulate an order queue for future order processing features.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Java Swing**: For the GUI framework.
- **Data Structures**: `LinkedList`, `Stack`, `Queue` for application logic.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Modular and reusable design patterns.
